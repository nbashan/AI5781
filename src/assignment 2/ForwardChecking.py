# As we did in class,
# we will represent the board as a one-dimensional array where each position
# in the array is the n'th queen's column value. So if the array is: [1, 3, 0, 2],
# then the first queen is in position 1 (from 0--3), the second queen is in position 3 (the last column),
# the third queen is in the first column and the last queen is the in the second position.

columns = []
# columns is the locations for each of the queens
# columns[r] is a number c if a queen is placed at row r and column c.


# Our method is as follows:
# we construct a matrix corresponding in size to the calendar of the queens.
# At first the whole matrix is filled with "0".
# Each queen we put on the board we mark all the places it threatens by changing their contents
# from 0 to the position of the matrix on the board.
# for example if in square [1,1] we put a queen
# then we mark all its diagonals (which marked with 0) and its column marked [1,1].
# In this way we will know to eliminate the specific threats
# that this queen has created when we remove the queen in the backtrack process.
